# How to use Optical Illusions to Illustrate Mathematical and Coding Concepts

## Awknowledgement

The optical illusions are recreated from [the work of Akiyoshi Kitaoka](https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/~akitaoka/index-e.html).

## The Illusions

**WARNING - Some of these illusions may cause motion sickness.  If you feel dizzy please navigate away. One of the illusions below have a "strobe light" like effect and have been marked as such in the description.**

The following are some optical illusions that can be relatively easily recreated

* [slants](https://illusions-2025.github.io/illusions-2025/slants.html) - horizontal lines of circles appears to be slanted
* [bulge](https://illusions-2025.github.io/illusions-2025/bulge.html) - a set of squares appear to have a bulge in the middle
* [wave](https://illusions-2025.github.io/illusions-2025/wave.html) - a 2D grid appears to be waving
* [reverse-phi](https://illusions-2025.github.io/illusions-2025/reverse-phi.html) - **WARNING, has a bit of a strobe light** a ring of ovals appear to rotate

## Why these?

* Each illusion was chosen for its simplicity in geometric form.  They have easy to draw components (rectangles circles and triangles for the most aprt) 
* Illusions that involve using a photo or image can be harder to render locally due to cross origin policies on browsers.  Thus only illusions that can be drawn entirely through code were chosen for easy rendering. Something to keep in mind if you want to adapt other illusions

## p5.js

[p5.js](https://p5js.org) is JavaScript version of the Processing and one of the big advantages is that p5.js sketches works natively on the web!  Your students can show case their work on their own web pages without alteration.

While this particular talk uses p5.js, the methodology can be adapted to use other members of the [processing family](https://processing.org).  Thus if you happen to teach Python or Java, you can adapt these to use processing.py or processing.
